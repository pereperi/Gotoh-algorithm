# Gotoh-algorithm
Implementation in python of the Gotoh algorithm for making pairwise alignments of sequences using affine gap penalties
Input needs to be a .fasta file containing both sequences (as seen in seq.fasta as an example), and a substitution matrix, that MUST have the same 
format as the matrix.txt file (added as an example).
